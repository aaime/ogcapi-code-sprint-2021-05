==== GeoSolutions

GeoSolutions deployed an instance of the GeoServer product. GeoServer is a Java-based software server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards by the OGC, GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing. For this code sprint, the server was configured to offer an endpoint supporting:

* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the draft OGC API - Styles - Part 1: Core specification.
* Multiple conformance classes and recommendations of the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core Standard.

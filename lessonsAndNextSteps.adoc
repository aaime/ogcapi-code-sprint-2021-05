= Immediate Lessons and Next Steps

== Immediate Lessons

* The Tiles API is reasonably stable. We have seen different interpretations of how to apply styles to collections maps and the dataset maps.
* Evolution of WKSS into common TMS (the ones that are going to be registered). The evolution has taken us to a conclusion that WKSS.
* The concept of buildings blocks has been completely demonstrated. The three APIs have been successfully demonstrated together.
* The sprint has shown that a lot that is common can be shared across the APIs i.e. how much OGC API - Common - Part 2 facilitates the client implementation.
* The interaction between Maps, Tiles, Styles worked well. No major issues came up that could not be verified.
* More work needs to be done on Styles in general. e.g. where we use the styles has an impact on the resources.
* We focused on the API aspects of the styles but not on the formats of the styles. More work is needed on the formats aspects of the styles (e.g. SymCore).
* While in the Tiles API we have developed a metadata model, in the Maps API there has been less interest in developing a specific metadata model.

== Implications for the needs of NMAs

What will the APIs do to help meet the following needs?

* Providing the public with access to geospatial data and maps
* Facilitating analytics
* Reducing barriers to accessing geospatial data

== Next steps

How will the sprintâ€™s outcomes will be incorporated into future OGC Standards Program and Innovation Program activities?

=== Next Steps for the Innovation Program

There is a need to:

* experiment with multidimensional support in OGC APIs.
* explore how we turn legends into real data(objects) that can be combined by the client (e.g. asking a client to provide the elements that are in a legend).
* research how simple a structure needs to be to meet the needs for a legend while also being easily implementable.
* Coverage tiles are increasingly important (e.g. in support of rendering DSM's and DDIL environments).  Strategies for the size of the tiles needs to tested/researched.
* TBA
* TBA

=== Next Steps on the Standards Program

There is a need to:

* implement a legend capability for the Maps and Tiles APIs.
* implement an info capability for the Maps and Tiles APIs.
